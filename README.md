# Outlining the relationship between regime and economic development
Here you'll find all files associated with this project, primarily:
1. My RMD where I cleaned and merged my data, made all the graphs, and wrote my graphs and final data in as RDS files
2. My Shiny folder which contains
  
    a. prep.R where I did prep work for my shiny app (primarily saving graphs as PNGs)
  
    b. app.R which is my shiny, and contains all the coding for what you see when opening my Shiny App
  
All files have code comments in them which serve as explaining some choices I made and why, explanations for certain code, and helpful reminders when making this project. Additionally [here](https://abrar-trabulsi.shinyapps.io/regime_vs_economic_shiny/) is the link to the publicly available Shinyapp where you can view my data visualizations and analysis. 

Hope you enjoy!
